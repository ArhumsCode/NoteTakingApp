## My First Note Taking App
It's a very simple application but for me it was quite difficult due to not having any prior knowledge of ReactJS. I had to learn about react state how hooks work. How to seperate my functions in a clean and concise way and also how to pass props and use those props to update react components. It was an amazing learning experience and excited to keep learning!!
